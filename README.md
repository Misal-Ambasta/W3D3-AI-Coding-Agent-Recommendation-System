# AI Coding Agent Recommendation System

A sophisticated web application that recommends the best AI coding agents for your specific programming tasks. Built with modern technologies and featuring a beautiful glassmorphism UI design.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Task Analysis**: Analyzes natural language task descriptions to understand requirements
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Provides top 3 AI coding agent recommendations with detailed scoring
- **Multiple Strategies**: Choose from different recommendation strategies (Best Overall, Beginner Friendly, Enterprise Ready, Budget Conscious)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by budget, experience level, and team size
- **Detailed Scoring**: Transparent scoring breakdown across 5 key factors

### Scoring Algorithm
The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm with the following factors:

1. **Language Proficiency Match (30%)**
   - Exact language match: 100 points
   - Similar language family: 70 points
   - Basic support: 40 points

2. **Task Complexity Alignment (25%)**
   - Matches agent complexity rating with task requirements
   - Considers beginner-friendly vs advanced capabilities

3. **Use Case Specificity (20%)**
   - Direct use case match: 100 points
   - Related use case: 60 points
   - Generic capability: 30 points

4. **Integration & Workflow (15%)**
   - IDE compatibility
   - Team collaboration features
   - Setup complexity vs user experience

5. **Performance & Reliability (10%)**
   - Response time
   - Code quality metrics
   - User satisfaction scores
