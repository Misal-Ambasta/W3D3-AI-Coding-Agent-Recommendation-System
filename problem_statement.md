# Q: 2 - AI Coding Agent Recommendation System

Build a system that recommends the best coding agent for a given task.

## Core Requirements

- Accept natural language task descriptions
- Analyze task type, complexity, and requirements
- Recommend the top 3 coding agents with justification
- Support as many agents (Copilot, Cursor, Replit, CodeWhisperer, etc.)

## Implementation

Build a web app with:

- Task input interface
- Agent knowledge base (capabilities, system prompts, strengths)
- Recommendation engine with scoring algorithm
- Results display with explanations

## Deliverables

- `server.js` (main application)
- `agents_db.json` (agents knowledge base)
- `recommendation_engine.js`
- `README.md`
